# ðŸ¦  COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description

This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends, including cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries over time. It uses Python for data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and reporting.

## Objectives

* Import and clean COVID-19 global data
* Analyze time trends for cases, deaths, and vaccinations
* Compare metrics across different countries
* Visualize trends with charts
* Communicate findings through a clear report

## Tools and Libraries Used

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* matplotlib
* numpy
* Plotly (optional for choropleth map)

## How to Run / View the Project

1. Download the dataset `owid-covid-data.csv` from [Our World in Data](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv).
2. Place the CSV in the same folder as the project files.
3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python covid19_global_tracker.py
   ```
4. (Optional) Open the Jupyter Notebook `covid19_global_tracker.ipynb` to interactively explore and visualize data.

## Insights and Reflections

* The project provides a clear overview of COVID-19 trends across selected countries.
* Visualizations help identify patterns such as peaks in cases, vaccination progress, and differences between countries.
* Optional choropleth maps give a global perspective on vaccination rates.
* This project can be extended with predictive modeling or real-time data updates for deeper analysis.
